## Infrastructure Creation and Deployment

On this team, we'll create swarm clusters to support the infrastructure of the Continuous Integration and Deployment pipeline. The business has decided to move to production with a Docker-based Jenkins deployment, and your team has been tasked with creating the infrastructure. Due to the positive reception on first the SaaS-based POC, and then the local development environment of the MVP, we've decided to budget resources for a 12 node swarm cluster. 

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Create a script that will automate the installation of Docker Swarm
1. Install Docker Swarm on the cluster
1. Set up Jenkins on the cluster
1. Set up the pipeline from the local Jenkins MVP.
1. Test and scale!
1. Deploy the Hugo blog?
1. Blue/green deployments
