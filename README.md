## SaaS-based Continuous Integration and Deployment

In order to create organizational momentum to drive the adoption of DevOps and containers, the company is in need of a Proof of Concept (POC) to present to engineering management to prove the value of Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD).

To this end, we'll create a blog with a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). We'll use Github's built in hosting via [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/).

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Install Hugo locally on your laptop
1. Build a POC blog
1. Set up Github pages
1. Set up Continuous Deployment via a hosted CI system.
1. Post the guide as 3 posts to the blog!
