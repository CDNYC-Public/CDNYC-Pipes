## Infrastructure Creation and Deployment

On this team, we'll create swarm clusters to support the infrastructure of the Continuous Integration and Deployment pipeline. The business has a need for this MVP because of the POC proven in the `saas` branch of the repository, which has proven the value of Continuous Deployment with Software as a Service Tools.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Install Docker Swarm on the cluster
1. Create a script that will automate the installation of Docker Swarm
1. Set up Jenkins on the cluster
1. Set up the pipeline from the local Jenkins MVP.
1. Test and scale!
1. Deploy the Hugo blog?
1. Blue/green deployments
