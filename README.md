## Infrastructure Creation and Deployment

On this team, we'll create swarm clusters to support the infrastructure of the Continuous Integration and Deployment pipeline. The business has a need for this MVP because of the POC proven in the `saas` branch of the repository, which has proven the value of Continuous Deployment with Software as a Service Tools.

### Goals

We need to create a swarm cluster to support the MVP being created in the master branch around the local development environment.
